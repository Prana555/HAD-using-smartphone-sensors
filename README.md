# HAD-using-smartphone-sensors
This project focuses on detecting human physical activities (such as walking, sitting, standing, lying down, etc.) using data collected from smartphone sensors like the accelerometer and gyroscope. The goal is to build a machine learning model that classifies these activities based on time-series sensor data.
